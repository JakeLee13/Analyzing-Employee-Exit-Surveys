# Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys
### Jake Lee
## Introduction
In this project we play the role of a data analyst seeking to please our stakeholders invested in two institutes: The Department of Education for Training and Employment (DETE) and Technical and Further Education (TAFE).

We pretend our Stakeholders want to know the following questions regarding employee retention:
- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

To answer these questions we will clean, merge, and analyze a set of employee datasets gathered by the institutes which we will refer to as `dete_survey` and `tafe_survey` datasets.

See the Jupyter Notebook File above.
